Robert wasalso called "nepos" to Guillaume's great-aunt Agnès, wife of GeoffroyII Martel, count of Anjou, when at the age of 16 he witnessed acharter of hers. A 13th-century writer, plausibly drawing onan older source for family details, named Robert as one of fivebrothers along with Guillaume (four of them are attested in otherrecords).'[7]Further, Peter Stewart noted that Ordericus Vitalis identifiedErmengarde, daughter of William of Nevers, as niece (probably 'nepta')of Robert the Burgundian[7]'Robert le Bourguignon de Nevers'[4]cf.

<blockquote><p>Seigneur de Monfort et de Rochefort. Comte de Leicester.</p>
<p>Simon V de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester, Duke of Narbonne died in battle 25 June 1218 Toulouse He joined the misdirected Fourth Crusade, which, instead of the Holy Land, attacked the Byzantine Empire. Simon de Montfort objected and did not participate. After returning to France he became involved in the inheritance of his maternal uncle, the Earl of Leicester. His uncle's inheritance was divided between two sisters and, through his mother, Simon received the Earldom of Leicester and the Stewardship of England. In 1206 Simon de Montfort was recognised as Earl of Leicester and was granted lands by King John. However, in 1207 all his English lands were placed in charge of the Sheriff of Warwick and the revenues went to the king. However, Simon de Montfort was too actively involved in the Albigensian Crusade to stay in England and retain his inheritance. It was the last effort of Pope Innocent III to suppress the belief of the Cathars or Albigensians. With great cruelty and military ability he pursued the Cathars for nearly ten years (1209-1218) and because of his efforts gained the county of Toulouse and the duchy of Narbonne. To show his appreciation the pope supported Simon's claim to the English inheritance and always called him Earl of Leicester. On the pope's request, in 1215 the English lands were committed to Ranulf, Earl of Chester, who was Simon's relative. However, in 1218 while besieging the city of Toulouse, Simon died, struck on the head by a stone pitched from a mangonel used to defend the city. An epitaph described him as: "He was another Mars, because warlike; another Paris, because beautiful; another Cato, because adorned by good morals". <br>

<p>1.Amaury VII de Montfort, Duke of Narbonne, Comte de Toulouse died 1241 Otranto He had none of the military talents, enthusiasm or prestige of his father. As his father's eldest son, he became Lord of Montfort. To help a younger brother, Simon de Montfort, in 1230 Amaury gave him a charter to the rights of their family's English inheritance which included the Earldom of Leicester. Amaury de Montfort became both Constable of France and Count of MOntfort and as such became a very powerful man in France. In 1235 and again in 1239 he went to England to assist his brother Simon, then officially renounced his own rights for his brother. He returned to France only to go on crusade. No sooner had he arrived than he was captured by the infidels and, in 1240, had to be ransomed by the Earl of Cornwall. On his return home he arrived in Otranto in 1241, only to fall ill and die. He was buried in Rome's St.Peter's. married circa 1214/1222 Carcassonne Beatrix de Viennois, daughter of Guigues VI, Dauphin de Viennois, and Beatrix de Sabran born circa 1205, died after 18 September 1248. </p>
